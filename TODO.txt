1. Maybe use some of this cool hover stuff : http://gudh.github.io/ihover/dist/ (scale up/down is cool)
2. Allow comments to be added (this may require a new route where we pass in the blog url)
2. Create some new SignalR stuff that will also use the current users subscriptions (which can be read from cookie, see subscriptions, and
   https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngCookies/service/$cookieStore)


   dependency

   '$cookieStore'

   usage : var allFriendsSubscriptionsCookie = $cookieStore.get('allFriendsSubscriptions');


3. Do the   animating of the views : http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/animating-angularjs-apps-ngview
